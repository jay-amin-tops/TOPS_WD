    <h2> comments </h2>
    <p>The comment tag ( &lt;!-- Comment--&gt;) is used to insert comments in the HTML code. It is a good practice of coding, so that coder and the reader can get help to understand the code. It is useful to understand steps of the complex code. The comment tag is helpful while the debugging of codes.</p>
<p> It is a simple piece of code that is wiped off (ignore) by web browsers i.e. , not displayed by the browser. </p>
<p> It helps the coder and reader to understand the piece of code used for especially in complex source code. </p>

<p><b> Single-line comment:</b>  Single line comment is given inside the ( &lt;!--  comment --&gt; ) tag.</p>
<p><b>Multi-line comment:</b> Multiple lines can be given by the syntax (&lt;!-- --&gt;), Basically it’s the same as we used in single line comment, difference is half part of the comment (” -&gt; “), is appended where the intended comment line ends.  </p>

<h2><mark> html tag </mark></h2>
<p> HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags. </p>
<p>When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.</p>
<p>An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can differentiate between a simple text and HTML text. You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.</p>
<p>All HTML tags must enclosed within &lt; &gt;  these brackets. </p>
<p>Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.</p>
<p>If you have used an open tag &lt;tag &gt;, then you must use a close tag &lt; /tag &gt; (except some tags)</p>
<h2>self closing </h2>
<p>Most of the HTML elements are surrounded by start and end tags to specify the starting and end of the element.</p>
<p>There is a special group of elements that only have start tags and does not contain any content within it, these elements are called void elements. Void elements doesn’t have ending tags and can only have attributes but do not contain any kind of content. These elements can have backslash before ending of start tag but that is completely optional. Example of such elements are &lt;br &gt; ,&lt;hr &gt;, &lt;img&gt;,&lt;input &gt;,&lt;link &gt;,&lt;base&gt;,&lt;meta&gt;,&lt;area&gt;,&lt;source&gt;</p>
